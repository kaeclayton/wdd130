                        <h3>Isaak Fulano</h3>
                        <p>Isaak is our fearless leader carrying on the family business.
                            Isaak grew up like his father practically living in the
                            Grand Canyon, on the Colorado River.  He loves showing
                            others how to love the adventure that is white water rafting.
                            Isaak is married to Samantha and they have three children
                            who are also growing up to love the river.  In his free
                            time (enter laughter here), Isaak enjoys fishing and writing
                            short stories for the local newspaper.  Aside from living 
                            life to the fullest on the river, Isaak has an ambition to
                            write a book series about adventures on the river.</p>

                        <p>Micaela has been with Expeditions for the past 12 years.
                            She has loved her experience helping others find the joy of
                            rafting.  In her spare time Micaela uses her creativity to
                            in painting and sculpting scenes and such from the Grand
                            Canyon. She has several artworks displayed at different 
                            places in and near the canyon visitors centers.

                        <p>Caleb is the newest member of Exciting Expeditions.  While he 
                            is new to us he is not new to river rafting.  He has spent
                            time on rivers since he was a child and he is well versed
                            in how to handle the rapids.  Caleb is a gamer in his spare
                            time and enjoys a variety of different genres of games.
                            Another hobby of Caleb's is music.  He entertains on the 
                            longer trips with his musical prowess.

                        <h3>Abram Knight</h3>
                        <p>Abram is our tenacious guide.  He, like Isaak, grew up in 
                            the area and knows all the ins and outs of the legends 
                            and lore of the area making calm moments on the river 
                            a real learning experience.  Abram is an ultra-marathon 
                            runner and has ambitions to travel Europe on foot one day.
                            Also he is an excellent comedian.

                        <p>Don't let her age fool you, Finnley is a fierce one in the 
                            rapids.  While she may be the youngest of our crew, she is 
                            the one who is the most adventurous in the water and 
                            extremely capable of maneuvering the rafts with ease.  
                            Finnley loves nature.  Her love of wildlife, bugs and 
                            lizards makes her our resident expert on the subjects.
