        <p>
            Hi! My name is Kae Clayton. I live in Mesa, Arizona, but I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.
            I am a mom of 5 kids ranging in age from 7-24. Two have left the nest leaving our three youngers
            at home. They keep me very busy. I love being a mom, but I am excited to be working on finally
            finishing my bachelor's degree. I have tried several times to do so over the course of my post 
            high school life. I love all languages, I speak two (obviously English with Spanish being the 
            second) and I am learning 4 more spoken languages (French, Italian, Portuguese and Hawaiian).
            Why am I learning these? I seem to have a talent for language and I am trying to grow that talent.
            (Also I want to speak these languages when I eventually visit locations that speak them. üòâ)
            Aside from these spoken languages I also love math and coding which I consider universal languages.
            I look forward to adding to that knowledge by learning how to make web pages.

        <p>Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States. Many think of our state as just a hot dry
            desert full of cacti. While this is true of many parts of Arizona, we also have lakes, mountains
            and snow! You can find a little of everytihng here. One of my favorite places is the Grand Canyon!
