            Hi! My name is Kae Clayton. I live in Mesa, Arizona, but I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.
            I am a mom of 5 kids ranging in age from 7-24. Two have left the nest leaving our three youngers
            at home. They keep me very busy. I love being a mom, but I am excited to be working on finally
            finishing my bachelor's degree. I love all languages, I speak two (obviously English, Spanish
            being the second) and I am learning 4 more spoken languages (French, Italian, Portuguese and
            Hawaiian), but I also love math and programing languages. So I look forward to adding HTML to
            my list of understood languages.
        </p>
